Facebook Example
----------------

A simple Flask demo app that shows how to login with Facebook via rauth.

Before you begin you must run \`from facebook import db; db.create_all()` from
the python interpreter from within the facebook directory!

When viewing the example, please make sure that you connect to 127.0.0.1:5000,
which is the default running URL. If you connect to another address, the facebook
integration will not work
